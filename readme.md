# CSV assignment server

To use the server for this assignment you'll need to clone this repository and then run npm install to install the dependencies. Afterwards you can run node index.js or nodemon if you have that installed to run the server. If the server is running you can go to the repository with the client side to upload the data.csv file here [client](https://github.com/gijsmaas82/csv-client). I used xampp and localhost/phpmyadmin as my GUI to check if my database and table were created correctly.
